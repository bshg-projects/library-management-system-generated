# Library Management System - Generated by [BSH Code Generator](https://github.com/bsh-generator)

This Library Management System project is generated by BSH Code Generator, an automated code generation tool that accelerates the development process. The generator provides a scaffold for a fully functional Spring-based blog system, saving time and effort in setting up the initial structure.

## Project Details

The Library Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to efficiently manage various aspects of a library's operations. The system is organized into distinct entities, each responsible for specific functionalities. Here's an overview of the key components:

### User Management
- **Admin and Employee Entities:** The system includes user entities for administrators and employees, with specific roles and associated permissions.
- **Employee Assignment:** Admins can assign roles to employees, specifying details such as assignment role, start and end dates, and active status.

### Content Management
- **Author, Book, Genre, Publisher, Category, and Magazine Entities:** These entities cover the management of library content, including details about authors, books, genres, publishers, categories, and magazines.
- **Book Authorship:** Authors can be associated with books, indicating their contribution percentage and role in the creation of the book.
- **Genre and Magazine Associations:** Genres can be associated with books in a many-to-many relationship, and magazines can be associated with genres.

### Library Operations
- **Loan, Reservation, Review, Library Branch, and Membership Entities:** These entities handle various library operations, such as loans, reservations, reviews, library branches, and client memberships.
- **Address and Country Entities:** Provide address details for library branches and client locations.
- **Membership Status:** Tracks the status of client memberships, including active, inactive, expired, pending approval, canceled, suspended, revoked, and grace period.

### Event and Transaction Management
- **Money, Event, Transaction, and Payment Entities:** These entities manage events, transactions, and payments, with a specialization in monetary details.

### Storage Management
- **Shelf and Rack Entities:** Handle the physical organization of books on shelves and racks within the library.

### Enums
- **AssignmentRoleType, ReservationStatus, MembershipStatus, and BookAuthorRole Enums:** Define constants for roles, reservation statuses, membership statuses, and book author roles, respectively.

The system is designed with a role-based access control (RBAC) approach, ensuring that different user roles have appropriate permissions for their tasks. It supports the creation, updating, deletion, and retrieval of information across various entities, providing a comprehensive solution for managing a library's diverse operations.
